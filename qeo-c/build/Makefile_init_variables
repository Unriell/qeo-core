##< The E variable
$(call addHelp,E,\
This variable is used to select the environment for which you want to compile.@\
It selects the compiler and sets target specific defines that can be used in@\
the other Makefiles and in the source code. If this variable is not provided it@\
will default to HOSTLINUX unless you specified a klocwork target - like@\
klocwork or kwinject - in which case it will be set to KLOCWORK.@\
@\
HOSTLINUX is a special environment that uses your host compiler to create a@\
build. It will search for a gcc in your path and use that to compile@\
everything.  Do not use this for cross-compilation - i.e. do not put a@\
cross-compiler called gcc first in the path and then put E=HOSTLINUX - as the@\
build environment will compile and execute some test applications compiled with@\
the found gcc to deduce key properties of your host platform.@\
@\
KLOCWORK is also a special environment that simulates a build in order to@\
generate a kwinject file which can then be used as input for the Klocwork@\
static code analyzer.,0._Variables_that_influence_the_build_process)
